Hi! I'm **hyperlynx**, also known as Jake. I've been coding in some shape or other most of my life by now, and I don't plan to stop anytime soon! I also do some creative writing, and I'm a big fan of a lot of scattered kinds of media.

I'm currently between work, so if you happen to need a programmer for really, truly anything and think I'd fit, tell me. Please.
